LWPx-Test-Recorder version 0.0.1

This is a basic module for "recording" LWP::UserAgent sessions for testing in
an environment without an Internet connection, or in cases where this would be
unwise because a successfull test requires a password or key.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

	./Build test
	./Build install
